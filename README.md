# Youtube_Download_Gui

Hi here is my youtube downloader. It's just a tool i have made in 3 hours so if you think you can improuve it creat an issue.
The main.exe is the same code but just through pyinstaller here is the virustotal of the file : https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/ODkxYzk0MjIyMGJiYTg3ODE5M2JkMDc1OGFlYzAyMTU6MTY5MjQ1MTkyNw== there are 5 false positives so here is how I compiled it :

1 : on an admin powershell : ``pip install pyinstaller``
2 : ``pyinstaller --onefile main.py --windowe``
3 : the exe is in the folder **dist**
